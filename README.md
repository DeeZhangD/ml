# machine-learning

### Main purpose:
More often than not, the baseline classification model is not the best-performing model. 
Different algorithms have different hyperparameters that can be adjusted to get a better-performing model. 
You will be tuning the hyperparameters, performing cross-validation, 
comparing the models based on their performances, and predicting the result (outcome) on the test dataset.
